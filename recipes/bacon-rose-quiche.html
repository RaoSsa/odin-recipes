    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (9 inch) unbaked deep dish pie crust </li>
      <li>13 slices bacon, divided </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon butter </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil </li>
      <li>1 cup cremini mushrooms, sliced </li>
      <li>1 small onion, diced </li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Swiss cheese</li>
      <li>½ cup shredded Gruyere cheese </li>
      <li>3 green onions, thinly sliced </li>
      <li>6 eggs </li>
      <li>1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon salt </li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder </li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon white sugar </li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper </li>         
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
</li>
      <li>Place 10 slices bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crispy and evenly browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and crumble.</li>
      <li>Heat butter and olive oil in a same skillet over medium heat. Stir in mushrooms and onion. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms and onions are slightly brown and tender, about 8 minutes.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle mushroom-onion mixture, crumbled bacon, Swiss cheese, Gruyere cheese, and green onions into the pie crust.</li>
      <li>Whisk eggs slightly in a bowl; beat in cream, 3/4 teaspoon salt, garlic powder, sugar, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper. Pour egg mixture carefully into the pie crust.
</li>
      <li>Thread a toothpick through 1 end of 1 of the remaining bacon slices; roll the bacon around the toothpick to form a rose shape. Repeat with the remaining bacon slices. Arrange bacon roses on top of the quiche.
</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.
</li>
      <li>Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Continue baking until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 30 minutes more. Cover with aluminum foil if top is getting too brown. Let quiche rest for 10 minutes before cutting.
</li>
    </ol>
